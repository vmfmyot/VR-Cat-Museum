# VR Cat Museum

Virtual Reality cat museum developped in 4 week, as a final project for a Fundamentals of eXtended Reality class.

## Authors

This project was made by [Sidonie Minodier](https://github.com/shidowe), [Victoria Myot](https://github.com/vmfmyot) and [Gleda Uisetiawan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gledaui/), 1st year HCI Master students at Paris-Saclay University.

## Project Description

This project aims to stimulate an interactive virtual museum visit. The objective of such VR-based visits is to enrich
and enhance visitors' experience during museum exhibitions or excursions. In addition, VR makes it
possible for visitors to explore inaccessible, hard-to-reach places, and to recreate sites and artefacts
that were destroyed long ago. Interactive exhibits designed for both adults and children can further
support learning by providing engaging ways to discover the history of an artifact or a ruin.

Our museum is cat-themed, and consists in 3 rooms :
- An egyptian/antique-themed exhibition
- A modern art exhibition
- A main room to display skeletons and other decorations

## Tools

This project was developped on the Unity Game Engine, using an HTC Vive Pro 2 headset. \

Our museum layout was designed and built using the SweetHome3D software. However, the rest of our 3D assets were all found online and are free-of-use. Credits will be given further below.


## Implemented features and groupmembers contributions

We mostly worked on the project on-site in order to gain access to the hardware, so most features were implemented as a group.

### _3D museum layout_
Basic sketch layout was designed as a group. Complete 3D modelisation (with assets embedded) made by **Gleda**.

### _Ambiant lighting_
When getting close to an artifact, light appears to ............. This feature was handled by Gleda.

### _Colliders and physics_
**Sidonie**

### _3D artifacts and assets_
Exhibitions themes were decided as a group. 3D assets collection, import and resizing handled by **Victoria**.

### _Virtual navigation_
Player can use the joystick to move around the museum (glyding metaphor). It is advised to use both joysticks when playing. Virtual navigation implemented by **Sidonie**.

### _Spatial audio_
Each room has their own background music that fits the theme of the exhibition. When moving from one room to the other, the audio changes accordingly. This feature was handled by **Gleda**.

### _Ray casting manipulation of objects_
Some objects, such as Information Panels and the Puzzle Minigames are interactable through ray casting. This part was handled by **Sidonie and Victoria**.

### _Puzzle minigame_
Our museum has a small puzzle minigame with grabbable pieces. This was implemented by **Sidonie**.

### _Information panels_
Each artifact has a scrollable canvas that displays information with a 3D TextMeshPro. Artifacts information was gathered by **Gleda and Victoria** and **Victoria** added the panels to the museum.


### _Timer_
We added a timer to count down the time spent in the museum. This timer UI is always visible to the player. Canvas and scripting implemented by **Victoria**.


### _Project report_
The README.md was written by **Victoria**.

##  Challenges encountered

- ray
- movement
- left and right controllers issues : turning off when game starts,
switch between move and teleport randomly appearing
- camera falling on the ground when grabbing an objective
- time constraints
- stuff copy-pasted from the tutorial setup doesn't necessarily work (koff koff)
